## Registration Form
In this project, HTML is used to define the structure of the form, including input fields such as text boxes, dropdown menus, checkboxes, and buttons. Each input element is assigned attributes such as type, name, and placeholder text to specify its purpose and behavior.

CSS is employed to enhance the aesthetics and layout of the registration form. It includes styling properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and positioning to create a cohesive design that aligns with the overall theme of the website or application. CSS can also be used to make the form responsive, ensuring it displays correctly on various devices and screen sizes.

Additionally, the registration form may incorporate client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that users provide valid input before submitting the form. This helps prevent errors and ensures data integrity. Overall, the registration form project demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS for creating interactive and visually appealing web forms.
